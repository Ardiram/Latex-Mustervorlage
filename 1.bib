  abstract = {The Diels--Alder reactions of cyclopentadiene with maleic anhydride and with some other dienophile models in which the C=O bonds were replaced by less polarizable C=NH bonds and by C=CH               2               bonds were studied theoretically. Comparison of interactions in these systems disclosed a key to understanding the high reactivity of maleic anhydride and the               endo               selectivity in the reaction. It is not orbital interactions that favor the               endo               addition, but the electrostatic attractions introduced by the presence of highly polarized C=O bonds. The bonds also play important roles in depressing the unfavorable growth of overlap repulsion by storing a large amount of {$\pi$}-type electron populations outside the region of interactions and in strengthening electron delocalization by providing a positive charge field to the reaction sites of the dienophile.},

    abstract = {In the past, basis sets for use in correlated molecular calculations have largely been taken from single configuration calculations. Recently, Almlöf, Taylor, and co‐workers have found that basis sets of natural orbitals derived from correlated atomic calculations (ANOs) provide an excellent description of molecular correlation effects. We report here a careful study of correlation effects in the oxygen atom, establishing that compact sets of primitive Gaussian functions effectively and efficiently describe correlation effects if the exponents of the functions are optimized in atomic correlated calculations, although the primitive (sp) functions for describing correlation effects can be taken from atomic Hartree–Fock calculations if the appropriate primitive set is used. Test calculations on oxygen‐containing molecules indicate that these primitive basis sets describe molecular correlation effects as well as the ANO sets of Almlöf and Taylor. Guided by the calculations on oxygen, basis sets for use in correlated atomic and molecular calculations were developed for all of the first row atoms from boron through neon and for hydrogen. As in the oxygen atom calculations, it was found that the incremental energy lowerings due to the addition of correlating functions fall into distinct groups. This leads to the concept of correlation consistent basis sets, i.e., sets which include all functions in a given group as well as all functions in any higher groups. Correlation consistent sets are given for all of the atoms considered. The most accurate sets determined in this way, [5s4p3d2f1g], consistently yield 99\% of the correlation energy obtained with the corresponding ANO sets, even though the latter contains 50\% more primitive functions and twice as many primitive polarization functions. It is estimated that this set yields 94\%–97\% of the total (HF+1+2) correlation energy for the atoms neon through boron.},

    abstract = {The convergence of the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) correlation energy with the cardinal number X is investigated for the correlation consistent basis-set series cc-pVXZ and cc-pV(X+d)Z. For the aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z series the convergence of the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is studied. It is found that, when d-shell electrons cannot be frozen, the cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets converge much slower for third-row elements then they do for first- and second-row elements. Based on the results of these studies criteria are deduced for the accuracy of auxiliary basis sets used in the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation for electron repulsion integrals. Optimized auxiliary basis sets for RI-MP2 calculations fulfilling these criteria are reported for the sets cc-pVXZ, cc-pV(X+d)Z, aug-cc-pVXZ, and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z with X=D, T, and Q. For all basis sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation energy is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the usual basis-set error. For the auxiliary aug-cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pV(X+d)Z sets the RI error in the MP2 correlation contribution to the dipole moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the usual basis set error. Therefore extrapolations towards the basis-set limit are possible within the RI approximation for both energies and properties. The reduction in CPU time obtained with the RI approximation increases rapidly with basis set size. For the cc-pVQZ basis an acceleration by a factor of up to 170 is observed.},

abstract = {Abstract The Diels–Alder reaction has both enabled and shaped the art and science of total synthesis over the last few decades to an extent which, arguably, has yet to be eclipsed by any other transformation in the current synthetic repertoire. With myriad applications of this magnificent pericyclic reaction, often as a crucial element in elegant and programmed cascade sequences facilitating complex molecule construction, the Diels–Alder cycloaddition has afforded numerous and unparalleled solutions to a diverse range of synthetic puzzles provided by nature in the form of natural products. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of Alder's birth, selected examples of the awesome power of the reaction he helped to discover are discussed in this review in the context of total synthesis to illustrate its overall versatility and underscore its vast potential which has yet to be fully realized.},

These reactions proceed under mild conditions, give high yields, and form only inoffensive by-products. The Diels--Alder cycloaddition is one of the click reactions that do not require any metal catalyst; it is one of the most useful reactions in synthetic organic chemistry and material design. Herein, we highlight possible applications of the Diels--Alder reaction in pharmaceutics and biomedical engineering. Particular focus is placed on the synthesis of polymers and dendrimers for drug delivery, the preparation of functionalized surfaces, bioconjugation techniques, and applications of the Diels--Alder reaction in nanotechnology. Moreover, applications of the reaction for the preparation of hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering are reviewed. A general introduction to the Diels--Alder reaction is presented, along with a discussion of potential pitfalls and challenges. At the end of the article, we provide a set of tools that may facilitate the application of the Diels--Alder reaction to solve important pharmaceutical or biomedical problems.},

abstract = {Detailed density functional theory calculations definitively rationalize the preference for the endo cycloadduct (also known as endo rule) in text-book thermal Diels–Alder reactions involving maleic anhydride and cyclopentadiene or butadiene. This selectivity is mainly caused by an unfavorable steric arrangement in the transition-state region of the exo pathway which translates into a more destabilizing activation strain. In contrast with the widely accepted, orbital-interaction-based explanation for the endo rule, it is found that neither the orbital interactions nor the total interaction between the deformed reactants contributes to the endo selectivity. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The reactivity and endo/exo selectivity of the Diels--Alder cycloaddition reactions involving furan and substituted furans as dienes have been computationally explored. In comparison to cyclopentadiene, it is found that furan is comparatively less reactive and also less endo-selective in the reaction with maleic anhydride as the dienophile. Despite that, both the reactivity and the selectivity can be successfully modified by the presence of substituents at either 2- or 3-positions of the heterocycle. In this sense, it is found that the presence of strong electron-donor groups significantly increases the reactivity of the system while the opposite is found in the presence of electron-withdrawing groups. The observed trends in both the reactivity and selectivity are analyzed quantitatively in detail by means of the activation strain model of reactivity in combination with the energy decomposition analysis methods.}
